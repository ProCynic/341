\item
Consider the language $L$ of all strings drawn from the alphabet $\{a, b\}$ with at least two different substrings of length 2.
\begin{enumerate}

%a
\item
Describe $L$ by writing a sentence of the form $L = \{w \in \Sigma ^* : P(w)\}$, where $\Sigma$ is a set of symbols and $P$ is a first-order logic formula.  You may use the function $\card{s}$ to return the length of $s$.  You may use all the standard relational symbols (e.g., $=$,  $\neq$, $<$, etc.), plus the predicate  $Substr(s,  t)$, which is $True$ iff $s$ is a substring of $t$.

\item
Consider the language $A^nB^nC^n = \{a^nb^nc^n: n \geq 0\}$, discussed in Section 3.3.3.  We might consider the following design for a PDA to accept $A^nB^nC^n$:  As each $a$ is read, push two $a$'s onto the stack.  Then pop one $a$ for each $b$ and one $a$ for each $c$.  If the input and the stack both become empty, accept.  Otherwise reject.  Why doesnâ€™t this 
work?
\begin{proof}[Answer:]

\item
* Define a PDA-2 to be a PDA with two stacks (instead of one).  Assume that the stacks can be manipulated independently and that the machine accepts iff it is in an accepting state and both stacks are empty when it runs out of input.  Describe the operation of a PDA-2 that accepts $A^nB^nC^n = \{a^nb^nc^n : n \geq 0\}$.  (Note: we will see, in Section 17.5.2, that the PDA-2 is equivalent to the Turing machine in the sense that any language that can be 
accepted by one can be accepted by the other.)
