Prove that, if an instance of the Post Correspondence problem has a solution, it has an infinite number of solutions. (Hint: this is really easy.)

) Let $TILES = \{\brackets{T}$ : any finite surface on the plane can be tiled, according to the rules described in the book, with the tile set $T$\}.  Let $s$ be the string that encodes the following tile set:\\

//TODO: include graphics\\

Is $s \in TILES$?  Prove your answer.

\item
Is $L = \{\brackets{M}$ : $M$ is a PDA and $L(M) = \{x\ :\ x \in \{a, b\}^*$ and $\exists m\ (\card{x} = 2^m)\}\}$ decidable?  Prove your answer.

\item
A language $L$ is \textbf{D-complete} iff (1)  $L$ is in $D$, and (2) for every language  $L'$ in $D$,  $L' \leq _M L$.  Consider the following claim: If $L \in D$ and $L \neq \Sigma ^*$ and $L \neq \emptyset$, then $L$ is D-complete.  Prove or disprove this claim.

Let $\Sigma = \{1\}$.  Show that there exists at least one undecidable language with alphabet $\Sigma$.   (Hint: Use a counting argument.)

\item
The following sequence of figures corresponds to a fractal called a \textit{Koch island}:\\

These figures were drawn by interpreting strings as turtle programs, just as we did in Example 24.5 and Example 24.6.  The strings were generated by an L-system $G$, defined with:

\begin{align*}
\Sigma &= \{F, +, -\}.\\
\omega &= F - F - F - F
\end{align*}

To interpret the strings as turtle programs, attach meanings to the symbols in $\Sigma$ as follows (assuming that some value for $k$ has been chosen):
\begin{itemize}
\item
$F$ means move forward, drawing a line of length $k$.
\item
$+$ means turn left $90^\circ$.
\item
$-$ means turn right $90^\circ$.
\end{itemize}

Figure (a) was drawn by the first generation string $\omega$.  Figure (b) was drawn by the second generation string, and so forth.  $R_G$ contains a single rule.  What is it?
