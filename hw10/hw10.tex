\item
For each of the following languages $L$, state whether $L$ is regular, context-free but not regular, or not context-free and prove your answer.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
%a)
\item
\{$w$ : $w = uu^R$ or $w = ua^n$: $n = \card{u}$, $u \in \{a, b\}^*$\}.
\begin{proof}[Answer]
Context-free but not regular.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
This language is generated by this context-free grammar so it must be context-free:
\begin{align*}
S &\rightarrow A \mid B\\
A &\rightarrow aAa \mid bAa \mid \epsilon\\
B &\rightarrow aBa \mid bBb \mid \epsilon
\end{align*}\\
This language $L$ is not regualar.  Let $w = b^ka^k$ for some integer $k \geq 1$.  Then $y$ must be $b^p$ for some integer $p$ such that $1 \leq p \leq n$.  Pumping out $y$ generates a new string $w' = b^{k-p}a^k$ which is not in the language.  Therefore by the pumping theorem this language is not regular.
\end{proof}

%b)
\item
$\{a^nb^{2n}c^m\} \cap \{a^nb^mc^{2m}\}$.
\begin{proof}[Answer]
Not context-free.  This language is equivalent to $L = \{a^nb^{2n}c^{4n}\}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
Let $w = a^kb^{2k}c^{4k}$.  Let region 1 be the $a$'s, region 2 be the $b$'s and region 3 be the $c$'s.  In any case where $vxy$ crosses a region boundry, pumping in will result in a new string with out of order $a$'s $b$'s or $c$'s, and thus not in the language.  If $vxy$ is contained solely within a region, pumping out will disrupt the cardinality requirement, thus also generating a string not in the language.  Therefore by the pumping theorem for context-free languages this language is not context-free.
\end{proof}

%c)
\item
$L^*$, where $L = \{0^*1^i0^*1^i0^* : i \geq 0\}$.

$\lnot L_0$, where $L_0 = \{ww : w \in \{a, b\}^*\}$.

%e)
\item
$\{x \in \{a, b\}^*$ : $\card{x}$ is even and the first half of $x$ has one more a than does the second half\}.

\item
Give a decision procedure to answer the following question: given a context-free grammar $G$, does $G$ generate any even length strings?
\begin{proof}[Solution]

\item
Construct a standard, one-tape Turing machine $M$ to decide the language $L = \{x * y = z$ : $x$, $y$, $z \in 1^+$ and, when  $x$,  $y$, and  $z$ are viewed as unary numbers,  $xy =  z$\}.  For example, the string  $1111*11=11111111 \in L$.  Describe $M$ in the macro language described in Section 17.1.5.
\begin{proof}[Solution]
\end{proof}

\item
Construct a standard 1-tape Turing machine $M$ to compute the function $sub_3$, which is defined as follows:
\begin{tabular}{l c l}
$sub_3(n) =$&$n-3$ &if $n > 2$\\
&$0$&if $n \leq 2$.\\
\end{tabular}\\
Specifically, compute  $sub_3$ of a natural number represented in binary.  For example, on input 10111, $M$ should output 10100.  On input 11101, $M$ should output 11010.  (Hint: you may want to define a subroutine.)
